# AI-Trend-Analysis
Analysis and visualization of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs and industries specifically employment trends. Focusing on automation risk, and job growth/decline across industries and occupations worldwide.
Motivation:
The adoption of AI and automation technologies has drastically altered the labor market in recent years. This topic is highly relevant to me due to the ongoing concerns about job displacements, rising inequalities, and the need for workforce reskilling. Taking a global perspective allows for a comparative analysis of how countries with differing economic structures, levels of AI adoption, and technological readiness are impacted. Exploring this topic will provide insights on how AI adoption correlates with employment trends and can inform policymaking on the future of work.

Preliminary Information and Feasibility:
I have found relevant datasets and studies that confirm the feasibility of this project:
1.	AI-Powered Job Market Insights Dataset:
o	This dataset offers global insights into 500 job roles, industries, and regions, providing critical data points such as AI adoption levels, automation risk, job growth projections, and wages. These features allow for cross-country comparisons and detailed trend analyses.
2.	Brookings Institution Reports:
o	Provides analysis on AIâ€™s influence on various factors including job automation, highlighting regions with significant adoption rates and their corresponding socioeconomic impacts.
3.	International Labour Organization (ILO):
o	Reports on global employment trends and the impact of AI-driven reskilling on labor markets worldwide.


Visualization of Data:
The data will be cleaned and processed using Python and its respective libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn). The visualization will focus on presenting global trends in AI's impact on jobs using clear and intuitive visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, heat maps, and line graphs. The choice of additional tools, such as Tableau for creating interactive dashboards is under consideration but is not finalized.
